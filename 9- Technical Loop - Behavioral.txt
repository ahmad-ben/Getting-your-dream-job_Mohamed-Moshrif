Behavioral interview questions, often misunderstood as "soft skills". 
  Instead of just communication skills. 
  These questions assess cultural fit and work approach. 
    Which can be more important than technical skills, especially in higher-level roles.
Amazon is highlighted as a company that prioritizes behavioral assessments. 
  With its "Leadership Principles" forming a framework for evaluating candidates. 
Many major companies incorporate similar principles in their interview processes.
  Including Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.
Key Amazon Leadership Principles mentioned include:
  Customer Obsession:
    Prioritizing customer needs over competitors.
  Ownership:

  Amazon’s interview process places significant weight on these behavioral aspects. 
    Sometimes up to 80% for senior roles.

  When applying to a company, research their values and principles. 
    For each key value, find a real-life example from your experience that aligns with it. 
  This personalizes your application and makes you stand out.
