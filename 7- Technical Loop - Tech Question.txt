The full loop consists of multiple interviews:
  Typically four to six. 
  Covering various aspects such as: 
    Technical problem-solving, system design, behavioral questions, and managerial discussions. 
  The format and content depend on the company and the role's experience level.
Key advice includes:
  Engage the Interviewer: 
    Read the question aloud, especially in remote interviews.
      To keep the interviewer engaged and prevent them from mentally checking out.
  Ask Questions: 
    There's no penalty for asking;
      In fact, not asking raises red flags. 
    Senior candidates are expected to ask more questions than junior ones.
  Clarify Requirements: 
    Don't assume input constraints—ask if edge cases need handling.
  Provide Examples: 
    When discussing solutions, create your own examples instead of relying solely on given ones.
  Focus on the Interview’s Goal: 
    Not all interviewers are looking for the most optimized solution; 
      some focus on problem-solving approaches, system design skills, or communication.
  Start with a Simple, Clear Solution: 
    Avoid overcomplicating answers at first. 
      Begin with a straightforward approach and refine if needed.
  Break Down Problems: 
    Solve issues step by step rather than tackling everything at once.
  Think from the User’s Perspective: 
    Consider whether the solution is for developers or end users.
      Which affects design decisions.
  Test with Normal Cases First: 
    Don't start with extreme edge cases; focus on standard use cases first.
  Mentally Reframe the Interview: 
    Treat it as a conversation with a potential colleague. 
      Rather than a high-stress evaluation to reduce anxiety.
