First Step Based on Experience:
  If a candidate has no experience or is applying for an internship: 
    They usually take an automated technical screen.
  If a candidate has experience, they go directly to a phone screen interview.
Automated Technical Screening:
  The candidate receives a link to an online test typically 60–90 minutes. 
    It has simple programming questions.
  The test is used to filter out candidates with no programming knowledge.
    Recruiter responses are usually quick after the test (1–2 days).
    The process aims to save engineers time.
    Candidates should practice solving problems efficiently. 
      While avoiding over complicating solutions.
  Questions are usually basic, covering data structures like stacks and queues.
    The goal of such problems is not to trick candidates. 
      It's to test basic coding logic and problem-solving ability.
  The test may allow Google searches.
    But only candidates with some programming knowledge will know what to search for.
  Scoring is usually automated, and passing is often set at 70% or higher.
LeetCode and Problem Solving:
  The video recommends LeetCode for practice.
  Premium subscriptions provide company-specific questions (e.g., Amazon, Facebook).
  Even the free version has categorized questions by difficulty level (easy, medium, hard).
  Candidates can focus on weaker areas like dynamic programming or hash tables.
Phone Screen Interview:
  If the automated test is passed, the next step is a phone interview with a team member.
  Depending on experience, this may include:
    Technical coding problems (LeetCode-style questions).
    System design questions.
    Management-related questions (for leadership roles).
    Questions tend to be harder than automated screening but easier than final loop interviews.
